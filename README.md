# youmart
You are the admin of an e-commerce app YouMart. The new year is here.  You want to give different vouchers to a different group of users. Currently in the admin portal while assigning the vouchers you are able to search for guest by first/last name or email address and assign it. This process is very redundant as the admin will have to search for each user based on their first name to assign it.  How would you make the voucher creation and assignment process easier? What other features do you think might be needed in this product to support your solution? *Note - we have access to the userâ€™s overall profile and activity log data.
