The new year is here. 

Admisn want to give different vouchers to a different group of users. 

Currently in the admin portal while assigning the vouchers Admins are able to search for user by first/last name or email address and assign it. 

This process is very redundant as admins will have to search for each user based on their first or name to assign the it. 

We need to make the voucher creation and assignment process easier.

Feel free to suggest other features might be needed in this product.
